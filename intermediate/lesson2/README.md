# Intermediate - Lesson-02

## Goal
* Use Basic Inheritance (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 10 p.467-503)

### Exercise 1
Create an Alien class. Include at least three protected data members of your 
choice, such as the number of eyes the Alien has. Include a constructor that 
requires a value for each data field and a toString() method that returns a 
String containing a complete description of the Alien. Save the file as 
Alien.java.

### Exercise 2
Create two classes—Martian and Jupiterian—that descend from Alien. 
Supply each with a constructor that sets the Alien data fields with values 
you choose. For example, you can decide that a Martian has four eyes but a 
Jupiterian has only two. Save the files as Martian.java and Jupiterian.java.

### Exercise 3
Create an application that instantiates one Martian and one Jupiterian. Call 
the toString() method with each object and display the results. Save the 
application as CreateAliens.java.

### Exercise 4
Create a class named Horse that contains data fields for the name, color, and 
birth year. Include get and set methods for these fields. Next, create a subclass 
named RaceHorse, which contains an additional field that holds the number of 
races in which the horse has competed and additional methods to get and set 
the new field. Write an application that demonstrates using objects of each class. 
Use toString to print all the field values of Horse and RaceHorse.
Save the files as Horse.java, RaceHorse.java, and DemoHorses.java.
DemoHorses will call the toString method.
