# Intermediate - Lesson-01

## Goal
* Use Arrays primitive and Objects (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 8 p.370-391   )


### Exercise 1
Write an application that stores nine integers in an array. Display the integers
from first to last, and then display the integers from last to first. Save the file as
NineInts.java

### Exercise 2
Allow a user to enter any number of double values up to 15. The user should
enter 99999 to quit entering numbers. Display an error message if the user quits
without entering any numbers; otherwise, display each entered value and its
distance from the average. Save the file as DistanceFromAverage.java.

### Exercise 3
Create an application containing an array that stores eight integers. The
application should call five methods that in turn (1) display all the integers,
(2) display all the integers in reverse order, (3) display the sum of the integers,
(4) display all values less than a limiting argument, and (5) display all
values that are higher than the calculated average value. Save the file as
ArrayMethodDemo.java.
