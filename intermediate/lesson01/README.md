# Intermediate - Lesson-01

## Goal
* Use Arrays primitive and Objects (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 8 p.370-391   )


### Exercise 1
Write an application that stores nine integers in an array. Display the integers
from first to last, and then display the integers from last to first. Save the file as
NineInts.java

### Exercise 2
Allow a user to enter 15 numbers of double values. Display the average first.
Display each entered value and its distance from the average. Save the file as DistanceFromAverage.java.

```bash
Average: 10
1,9
10,0
9,1
...
```

### Exercise 3
Create an application containing an array that stores eight integers. 
Allow a user to enter the 8 integers. 
The application should call five methods that in turn 
(1) display all the integers,
(2) display all the integers in reverse order, 
(3) display the sum of the integers,
(4) display all values less than the average, and 
(5) display all values that are higher than the calculated average value. 
(6) Exit
From 1 to 5, create separate static method for each operation.
Save the file as ArrayMethodDemo.java.
