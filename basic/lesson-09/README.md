# Lesson-09

## Goal
* Making loop using for-loop (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 6 p.300-305)

## Lesson-09 Exercises

### Exercise 1
Create a program that loops and prints 
each month from January to December.
This time use enhanced for loop.

Sample output:

```bash
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December
```

   
### Exercise 2
Write an application that counts by ten from 10 through 500 inclusive, and
that starts a new line after every multiple of 50 (50, 100, 150, and so on). 
Save the file as CountByTens.java. Use simple for-loop.

Sample output:

```bash
10,20,30,40,50
60,70,80,90,100
...
460,470,480,490,500
```

### Exercise 3
Copy and modify the CountByTen application so that the user enters the value to
count by. Start each new line after 10 values have been displayed. Save the
file as CountByAnything.java.

Sample output:

```bash
Please enter the interval of counting: 20

20,40,60,80,100,120,140,160,180,200
220,240,260,280,300,320,340,360,380,400
420,440,460,480,500
```
