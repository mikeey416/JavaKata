## Goal
* Adding Parameters to Method (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 3 p.121-125)
* Method Overloading (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 4 p.179-186)
* Class Constructor (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 3 p.150-152)
* Constructor Overloading (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 4 p.187-189, 192-197)


## Lesson-04 Exercises

### Exercise 1
Create overloaded 4 static methods with method name `sum` that accepts integer to add and return the sum.
The first method accepting two parameters, 2nd overloaded method with three parameters, and so on and so forth.

In the main method call all the static methods and print the sum.

### Exercise 2
Using the Exercise 1, convert it to a class with overloaded instance methods.
The class name is Adder.

Create another main class named `AdderMainClass`, where you instantiate an Adder
and call its methods and output the sum.
