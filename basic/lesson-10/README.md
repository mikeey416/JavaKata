# Lesson-09

## Goal
* Making loop using do-while-loop (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 6 p.306-308)
* Making Nested Loop (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 6 p.308-313)

## Lesson-10 Exercises

### Exercise 1
Write an application that counts by ten from 10 through 500 inclusive, and
that starts a new line after every multiple of 50 (50, 100, 150, and so on). 
Save the file as CountByTens.java. Use a nested for-loop.

Sample output:

```bash
10,20,30,40,50
60,70,80,90,100
...
460,470,480,490,500
```

### Exercise 2
Write an application that uses a loop to create the
pattern of Os shown in Figure 6-32, page325 of Joyce Farrel Book, 
in which each O is displayed one additional space to the right. Save
the file as DiagonalOs.java.

Sample output:

```bash
O
  O
   O
    O
     O
      O
       O
```
