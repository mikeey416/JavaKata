# Lesson-06

## Goal
* Making Decisions using if and if-else statements (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 4 p.233-237)
* Multiple statements in if and if-else statements (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 4 p.239-243)
* Nesting if and if-else (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 4 p.245-246)
* Using Logical Operator NOT(!), AND(&&) and OR(||)  (Joyce Farrel - Chapter 4 p.247-251)

## Lesson-06 Exercises

### Exercise 1
Create a java program that accepts an integer.
Using the arithmetic operator modulo(%), identify if the number 
is an odd or even number. 
**Note**: Use if-else.

Sample outputs:

```bash
Please enter an integer: 8

8 is an even number
```

```bash
Please enter an integer: 5

5 is an odd number
```

### Exercise 2
Accept a number from the user to guess the random number.  
If the user input is:
equal to the random number: Output is `Your guess is correct!`
higher than the random number:  Output is `Your guess is higher!`
lower than the random number:  Output is `Your guess is lower!`

**Note**: You will use IF once, ELSE IF once and ELSE once.

### Exercise 3
In the game Rock Paper Scissors, two players simultaneously choose one of three
options: rock, paper, or scissors. If both players choose the same option, then the
result is a tie. However, if they choose differently, the winner is determined as
follows:
• Rock beats scissors, because a rock can break a pair of scissors.
• Scissors beats paper, because scissors can cut paper.
• Paper beats rock, because a piece of paper can cover a rock.
Create a game in which two users enter their name.
Sample Output:
 ```bash
 Please enter name of first player: Russel
 ```
Save the name to firstPlayer variable.
 ```bash
 Please enter name of second player: Jan
 ```
Save the name to secondPlayer variable.

Then ask firstPlayer and secondPlayer to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
Let the players enter a number 1 for Rock, 2 for Scissors, or 3 for Paper.

Sample Output:
 ```bash
 Hi Russel! Please choose (1 - rock, 2 - scissors, or 3 - paper): 
 ```

Then, determine the winner. Save the application as RockPaperScissors.java.
